## **PROJECT OVERVIEW**
In the digital age, consumer sentiments hold immense power, especially in the e-commerce landscape where customer opinions can significantly influence purchasing decisions. Among the various platforms that capture customer feedback, **Amazon** stands as a key player with a vast repository of product reviews. These reviews offer invaluable insights into customer satisfaction, product quality, and the factors that drive consumer purchasing behavior.

# PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews and develop predictive models for sellers.
The main objectives include:

*   Sentiment Prediction: Classify product reviews into positive, negative, and neutral categories using various machine learning models.

* Performing clustering to identify product categories.

*   Creating a recommendation system for users based on sentiment and rating

*   Using regression models to predict future ratings and product success

*   Review Clustering: Identify clusters of similar reviews based on product features, sentiment, and ratings

*   Feature Extraction and Importance: Identifing the key features (e.g., price, brand, category) that influence product ratings and sentiment

* Using techniques such as ensemble learning, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and deep learning to improve prediction accuracy.

* An**interactive data visualization**which includes an interactive dashboard developed with **Dash**, which will allow users to explore sentiment distributions, visualize trends, and gain a deeper understanding of customer feedback in real-time.

## **DATASET**
The dataset used in this project includes Amazon product reviews, with key features such as:

Product Information: Name, brand, and category.
Review Data: Rating, helpfulness score, sentiment, review text, title, and username.
The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, tokenize review text, and convert categorical variables into numerical representations.

## **PROJECT STEPS:**

### 1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
The project begins by gathering and preparing a dataset of Amazon product reviews. This step involves retrieving essential information, cleaning the data to remove noise, and ensuring the dataset is ready for further analysis.handling missing data, remove duplicates, and structure the reviews for easier manipulation and processing.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing for Sentiment Analysis**
The next phase involves preparing the text data for sentiment analysis. Application of **text cleaning** techniques (removing punctuation, special characters, and stopwords) and **tokenization** to break down the reviews into meaningful words. Additionally, usage of **lemmatization** to reduce words to their base form, which helps improve the performance of machine learning models.

### 4. **Sentiment Labeling**
Each review will be labeled with a sentiment class, such as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**, based on the content of the review. This labeling will serve as the foundation for building sentiment analysis models.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
During the exploratory phase, the dataset's structure will be examined to   understand the distribution of reviews across different product categories, and identify any patterns or trends in customer sentiment. Key visualizations such as **sentiment distribution**, **word frequency analysis**, and **time-series analysis** will help reveal insights into customer preferences and behaviors.


### 5. **Text Vectorization**
To enable machine learning algorithms to interpret the text, a convertion of the reviews into numerical representations using **TF-IDF vectorization** or **word embeddings**. These techniques allow the model to understand the semantic meaning behind the words in the reviews.

### 6. **Model Development and Training**
Exploration of several machine learning models, including **logistic regression**, **random forest**, **support vector machines (SVM)**, and **neural networks**, to classify the sentiment of the reviews. The models will be trained using the labeled data, and their performance will be evaluated using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall, and F1-score metrics.**

### 7. **Model Evaluation**
Once the models are trained, then an evaluation of their performance on a test set. fine-tuning  hyperparameters and comparing different models to find the most accurate and reliable sentiment classifier.

### 8. **Interactive Sentiment Dashboard**
To present the findings in an accessible format, we will create an interactive dashboard using **Dash**. This dashboard will allow users to input Amazon product reviews, analyze their sentiment in real-time, and explore sentiment trends across different product categories. Users will be able to visualize the sentiment distribution, understand the impact of product types on sentiment, and gain deeper insights into consumer attitudes.

## **METHODOLOGY:**

### **Data Preparation and Cleaning**
The dataset was sourced from Amazon product reviews. To ensure high data quality, an extensive **data cleaning**  was done by removing special characters, HTML tags, and unnecessary metadata. also handling of missing values and duplicates to create a consistent dataset. The cleaned data was structured into a **Pandas DataFrame**, facilitating easy manipulation and analysis.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
During the EDA phase:
- **Data Overview**: The dataset's structure will be reviewed  and missing values identified
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated summary statistics to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Visualization of the breakdown of sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Identify the most frequently used words in product reviews.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyze how review sentiment has changed over time.
- **Product Category Sentiment Analysis**: Explore how sentiment varies across different product categories.

### **Text Preprocessing for Sentiment Analysis**
To prepare the data for sentiment analysis, through:
- **Text Cleaning**: Remove punctuation, special characters, and irrelevant data.
- **Tokenization**: Split the text into individual words.
- **Stopword Removal**: Remove common words that do not contribute to sentiment (e.g., "the", "and").
- **Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" to "run").

### **Sentiment Labeling**
**TextBlob** to perform sentiment analysis on each review, categorizing it into one of three labels: **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

### **Model Development and Training**
An experimentation with various machine learning models, such as **logistic regression**, **SVM**, and **random forest**, to classify the sentiment of product reviews. These models will be trained on the preprocessed dataset, and their performance will be evaluated based on **accuracy** and other metrics.

### **Interactive Dashboard**
Finally,  a dynamic dashboard using **Dash**, will be created using The dashboard allows users to:
- Input Amazon product reviews for sentiment analysis.
- View sentiment trends and product category-based sentiment distributions.
- Visualize key statistics and insights from the sentiment analysis.

## **CONCLUSION**
The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques on Amazon product reviews, showing how data can be transformed into valuable insights for sellers. By using a variety of models, the project explores:

Sentiment analysis to understand customer feedback.
Clustering to identify trends and patterns.
Time-series analysis to predict future trends.
Recommendation systems to enhance product recommendations.
The best-performing models are evaluated and selected based on accuracy and business relevance. The project concludes with a clear roadmap for improving product offerings based on predictive analytics.
